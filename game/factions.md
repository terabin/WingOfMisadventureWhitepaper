# Factions

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png>)

The faction system existed in all old versions of the Misadventure universe, that's because the world of Misadventure is in constant war and the center of everything revolves around two cities: Lilia and Lotos.\
\
In this new game we bring the faction war system, where players of the same faction will work together to defeat the enemy faction.

## Selecting the Faction <a href="#48fb" id="48fb"></a>

Unlike the old 2.0 version of the game, you will be able to choose your faction in character creation, this means that the faction is no longer linked to the avatar.

Members of enemy factions cannot perform some interactions with each other such as:

* Join the same party
* Join the same guild

## Faction Switch <a href="#0726" id="0726"></a>

You can pay a $MISAD fee to change your character's faction.

## PVP <a href="#c730" id="c730"></a>

Misadventure's open PVP revolves around factions, you can attack anyone, but defeating players from the same faction as yours will bring you severe penalties, the player's death so should be worth it.

## Dispute <a href="#6cb1" id="6cb1"></a>

Faction events will be constantly organised, for example:\
\-Faction that finished the most dungeons\
\-Faction that created the most items\
\-Faction that defeated the most enemies of the opposing faction\
\
Among other disputes that will bring temporary benefits to factions.

## Future <a href="#d9b0" id="d9b0"></a>

A system of government where the faction can elect a leader who will dictate the path of war.
