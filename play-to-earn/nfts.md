# NFTs

There will initially be three types of NFT in the Misadventure metaverse:

### Divine Remnants

These are creatures that represent the will of the gods and pets that you can equip and that will allow you to enter dungeons where there is a chance to drop $MISAD and other NFTs. Remnants are not stronger than non-NFT pets, but they do give great stats.

#### There are 7 types of Remnants elements:

Fire

Water

Earth

Wind

Light

Dark

Beast

#### And 4 types of rarities:

Common

Uncommon

Rare

Divine

#### The element affects the bonuses the Remnant will have in a given dungeon or day, the rarity increases the NFT and $MISAD drop chances:

Common: 0% bonus

Uncommon: 10% bonus

Rare: 25% bonus

Divine: 50% bonus

### Goddess Equipment

These are equipment with rarity above transcendent that can be turned into NFTs.

_\*Players will have the option to turn any in-game item into NFT by paying a $MISAD fee_

### Lands
