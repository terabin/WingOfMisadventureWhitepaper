# NFTs

There will initially be four types of NFT in the Misadventure metaverse:

### Divine Remnants

![NFT MISADGEN1](<../.gitbook/assets/MISADGEN1 (1).png>)

These are creatures that represent the will of the gods and pets that you can equip and that will allow you to enter dungeons where there is a chance to drop $MISAD and other NFTs. Remnants are not stronger than non-NFT pets, but they do give great stats.

#### There are 7 types of Remnants elements:

Fire

Water

Earth

Wind

Light

Dark

Beast

#### And 4 types of rarities:

Common

Uncommon

Rare

Divine

#### The element affects the bonuses the Remnant will have in a given dungeon or day, the rarity increases the NFT and $MISAD drop chances:

Common: 0% bonus

Uncommon: 10% bonus

Rare: 25% bonus

Divine: 50% bonus

### Goddess Equipment

These are equipment with rarity above transcendent that can be turned into NFTs.

_\*Players will have the option to turn any in-game item into NFT by paying a $MISAD fee_

### Lands

![Wing of Misadventure Land](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

Players will be able to have Lands where they can grow fruits, train pets and battle monsters.

Everyone will be able to enter other players' lands and defeat monsters or even face bosses in player lands.

All enemies defeated or resources collected generate resources that go to the landowner.

**Land defense**

Landowners will be able to place their NFTs Remnants to protect and walk their land.

The lands will function as dungeons, players will be able to attack the land and claim rewards if the landowner's NFTs are defeated.

In this case, landowners become part of the game's content, as they will be able to customize the land and its NFTs to face players.

There will be special rewards for the hardest lands to defeat!

**Main advantages of having a Land:**

\-Constant generation of resources with the visit of players&#x20;

\-Pets breeding training, obtaining NFT pets

\-Obtaining fruits, plants, food and other types of crafting materials&#x20;

\-$MISAD can be obtained by interacting with your own land

**There will also be the following rarities of lands:**

Common

Uncommon

Rare

Divine

**Rarity mainly represents the size of the land, which consequently increases the number of resources obtained:**

Common: size 1x

Uncommon: size 1.25x

Rare: size 1.5x

Divine: size 2.0x

## Maginekos

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Maginekos are magical cats with very sharp claws that will fight alongside you against the most diverse enemies in Misadventure, but more than companions, they are NFTs designed to go beyond the Wing of Misadventure.

There are a total of **9000** Maginekos, and they will be the only ones to exist in the entire ecosystem, this means that there will be no way to multiply Maginekos.

Initially only 5000 will be offered for sale. The other 4000 will be offered at special events with specific themes.

### Utility in DAPP <a href="#5bb4" id="5bb4"></a>

Players will be able to share the link of their maginekos on DAPP, and visitors will be able to pet the magineko by paying a fee of [$MISAD](usdmisad.md) (or any token where the Misad protocol interacts), when petting a Magineko you will receive [$TAMAS](usdtamas.md) and a random rarity NFT equipment.

The Magineko owner receives 90% of the [$MISAD](usdmisad.md) fee, and the 10% goes to the community treasury.

Maginekoâ€™s NFT gear is special, so be sure to pet a Magineko when you find one! Maginekos can produce 1 to 5 pieces of equipment per day based on Magineko's rarity/type.

### Maginekos by 4Tabern

In celebration of the creation of Maginekos, 4Tabern (developer of Wing of Misadventure) created 100 special Maginekos that can be obtained in the first 5000 Maginekos offered.

These 100 Maginekos feature 4 from 4Tabern logo and they are the only ones that can produce 5 pieces of equipment a day.

### Airdrop target

Holders of Maginekos NFTs will be the ones who will receive airdrops from the Magineko ecosystem as it develops.

### Exclusive combination

Each Magineko is unique, which means that there is no Magineko with the same combination of attributes and visuals.

Magineko parts are divided into:

\-Body

\-Eye

\-Head accessory

\-Clothing

\-Weapon

\-Background
